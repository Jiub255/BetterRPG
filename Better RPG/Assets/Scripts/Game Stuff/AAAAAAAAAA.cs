    fix pause system
        player still starts to swing weapon when clicking in invUI
        Use new input system to have player and UI controls separate?
            like disable player controls when menus are open, disable UI controls when not?

    finish combat system
        Clean up damage/healthManager setup. Might not want to use symbols,
            instead get healthManager reference on collision enter
        Finish Exp/level up system
        Fix death load screen, works as is, but could be better

    make invUI have infinite space
        use scroll bar

    fix item dropping (in InventoryUI script)
