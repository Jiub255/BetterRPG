    TODO
-------------

    Set up cinemachine/virtual cameras

    redo attack anims to make the empty game object which holds the actual weapon sprites
        be the one to move instead of the sprite. Allows for easy weapon changing. Same thing
        for ranged and magic attacks

    set up usable (from inv) items, and ones that act immediately when you touch them
