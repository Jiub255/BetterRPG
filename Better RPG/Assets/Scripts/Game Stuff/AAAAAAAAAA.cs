    TODO
-------------

    Make invUI have infinite space
        use scroll bar
   
    Fine tune Loot Menu 
        change UI a bit, clean it up, text sizes etc
        make UI fit with invUI
    
    UI
        Either keep HUD up or make it so you can see current hp/mp and stuff while in inv menu
        Design better looking UI, make HP/MP bars work/look fitting both in game and in inv menu
        Change all text components to TextMeshPro, change code accordingly
            Figure out blurry TMP issue

    Fix Scene Transition

    Move object pool, put it on an "in every scene" prefab
    
    Magic 
        Move spells to separate object? an "in every scene" prefab?
        Get currentSpell to persist between scenes
        Finish Wind Spell
        Make more spells

    Input System
        Set up gamepad, joystick, and other controls

    Stats
        Add speed stat. Makes the attack timer length shorter
        Flesh out defense, not using it much yet. Try different formulas

    Maybe do skill based "exp". Like Morrowind where you use a skill enough and it levels
        could add an exp int to the statSO class

    Build more world

    Finish combat system
        fine tune knockback
            fix player knockback
                disable movement/combat while knockingback player
        Finish Exp/level up system
        Fix death load screen, works as is, but could be better

    Save system

    Procedural generation of grass/ flowers etc?

    Fishing Minigame
